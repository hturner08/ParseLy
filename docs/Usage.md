# Getting Started
## Running Examples
First, navigate to the bin folder, which contains the python scripts we'll be using. Run python <script.name> -h for more information how to use each script. Example files can be found in the examples folder.
Below is an example run:

    cd bin
    python Parsing.py -f "../Examples/Para-13.mt" -o "outputted.txt"
    python Plotting.py -f "./outputted.3D"
