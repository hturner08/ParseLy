# Sprint 1
## Goals
- #### Pipeline A
No work will be done on the pipeline during this sprint
- #### Pipeline B
  1. Improve speed of parser.
      - The goal is to parse and write millions of data lines in just a few seconds
  2. Create Plotter module
      - Using the python visit module I'll be creating a module to for plotting outputted txt files from the parser as scatter plots or isosurfaces
  3. Writing Workflow Manual
      - Create a rough draft describing the workflow all the way from building the MCNP model in ibuilder excel spreadsheets to getting the images from VisIt
